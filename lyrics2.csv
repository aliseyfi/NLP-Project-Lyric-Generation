From beside me, 'cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always Look the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices they running out of options
'Cause I've been going off and they don't know when its stopping
And we came to the top and I see that you've been learning
And when I take you shopping you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
TrapMoneyBenny

From the block like you Jenny

nonstop,drake,"Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up! Look, I just flipped a switch (flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop (ayy, hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot
Give me my respect (give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex
Bitch, I move through London with the Euro step
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm goin' outta there (I'm gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap
Funny how they shook (ayy, got these niggas shook)
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I'm a hard hitta
Yeah, I'm light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm a unforgivin' wild-ass dog, nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a grave digger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again (My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the face is tickin')
(My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the face is tickin')

(My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the face is tickin')
(My head is-) Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that's standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went (they don't love you no more)
You don't wanna play with him (nah, nah, nah)
They'll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (woah, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (ooh, yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit, damn)
Either hand is the upper hand (oh, yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (oh, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can't go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that's hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man,
I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the face is tickin')
(My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the face is tickin')
(My head is spinnin', from smokin' the chicken, the face is tickin')

Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies [Chorus 2]

Yeah
Link Up TV, Behind Barz
Big up man like Rasheed, Joey, Tadas
Shoutout Giggs for settin' the ting
SN1, OVO
Mm-hmm, yeah, look [Hook 1]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones [Verse 1]
Stay in big six six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm getting up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm taking the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seeing a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're taking control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turning these yutes into dust [Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
Big Scorpion, out now, yeah, look [Hook 2]
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like R's and V's and O's
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
A good thing man weren't pullin' out phones [Verse 2]
Think you know me, that's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slew
Throwin' up six like man have flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried about sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans or crep
Or going to Milan or going to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that, let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, done that clash
Got no sense like jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots and cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like going tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that [Outro]
Yeah, Link Up TV
Drizzy Drake
Maddas, jheeze"
i'm-upset,drake,"Yeah
I'm workin' on dyin' I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect? Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta time, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool I'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' tryna settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'? I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a tech (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in a flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trynna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho"
hyfr,drake,"Gotta do what I gotta do All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where,
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say (And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say (And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright"

She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah

All of a sudden you say that I closed the door It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say (Girl, your love, you think you broke it)
(I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart)
(Girl, your love, you think you broke it)
(I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart)"
feeling,drake,"You know, you know
How the story go
You just jumped my style
You just stole my flow
You just seen me out
You gets no hello
And you wonder why?
Man you know, you know Yeah, and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in '02
And everybody saying I'm the man
So true Yeah, but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors
A space to put awards
A couple of parking spots
And maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted
And women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it
I doubt it I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playing like I'm being scouted till I'm out it
Game time bitch
I hope your proud of us
King James shit
Watch me throw the powder up
This old G got my whole suite clouded up
And I bet you I be outta time before I'm outta luck
They ain't rooting for me
They ain't clapping for me
I'm only saying iwhy can't someone be happy for me? I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know, you know
This is hard right
Please make your long story shorter
Cos time is at the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talking
I have nothing for reporters I just hope we get these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the alcalays
I'm the real reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my tax is paid
And I'm still spitting money from my active days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I could pull some fucking strings
So at courtside when I'm wrong get a fucking ring
Yeah, I bet I'll be there, I'll be there
You see that 62 sitting outside
That's me there
I'm jumping to the time that's my leap year
Prepare Putting in that overtime
I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishing that I could of done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurting
I got new girls but none of their love is for certain
I call old girls but none of their numbers are working
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change
You have to adjust How come when I gotta carter you stare at me in disgust?
I say it's just to have fun
You should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flying through the door
I can't ignore The paparazzi outside trying to record
Why's every woman never down here before?
Am I the only 23 year old, why can't I soar?
The rough child, the crews, the guy thats in the open seats
It's always nice when your out with someone who notices
A condo, got that art gallery openings
I'm just hoping that isn't what my hoping is
They ain't rooting for me
They ain't clapping for me
I'm only saying why can't someone just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue
But you know, you know"

emotionless,drake,"You've got me feeling emotions
Higher, ooh
You've got me fe-
You've, oh Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask is there anybody like me? You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
You've got me fe-
You, oh-h
Aye Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I'm tryna see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underage
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shi-
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but, who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higher
You've got me fe-
You've, oh-h
Aye
Higher, higher"
forever,drake,"It may not mean nothing to y'all

And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine Last name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo Drop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one Yeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
Bitches It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine Hey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to kill I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from me Old money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn't You are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine Okay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New Orleans And I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, ""To the top""
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme park My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mention I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine There they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose Back into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all

nothing-was-the-same,drake,"I love you so much

Isn't exactly what God had planne I guess all I can do is
Hope you can see the difference
And pray for the best
Please don't forget me... I will soothe your pain
I will ease your strength I should let you fall in love with
Someone else girl

You in Chicago
You're not patient

No more no (no more no)
Just think I'm where it all beginning
You're the envy of your prince

The miracle of change
But if we got together it will never be the same like before girl
And I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry girl
(Yeah)
She said look me in my fucking eyes and say it
But tell me am I wrong for what I'm saying Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear
Try to control us
You wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us down
Yeah you really wanna hold us All I asked is for a chance to prove that money can't really make me happy
Crazy how I blew myself from fucked up predicaments
I mean women inspire me to great things
(Drake:?)
I need to grow some fucking confidence
And why you gotta say the last words
And if I tell you how I really felt
(There probably end up being another argument candy girl,
You know everything you thought of me came from yourself)
Yeah
And that shit starts to get old
And I don't mean to say the most
But you know how they say you are who you hang with?
SO IT BOTHERS ME WHEN YOU HANG WITH HOES Is it wrong of me to tell these women what they wanna hear You know how they say

You and all your girls in the club one time

We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know. we know
You hate being alone well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you. instead they say: Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true I know you've been hurt by someone else

What do you really think of the nigga that's making your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours, then let him repeat
Now, you popping up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all putting pen to the sheets
Tired of sitting quiet, and helping my enemies eat
Keep getting temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spitting image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well, I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle and hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to their higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learning, yeah
Your brother said, it was your cousin then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happening lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger working double time
Ya'll acting like he made the boy when I was trying to help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly making me hits, but then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it, my spirit did it
I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you running behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playing with my name and I'ma let it ring on you

The way you talk to me but still I say I love you,
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes,

But what am I to do when her parents do not try, So many tears I cried,

I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more,
I just I cant I just can't be loving you no more,
I love you more than I love myself I've been so dependent on your love for so long,
Punishment for me is trying to let go,
Give it from your heart is what you taught me,
Addiction to pain is what it got me,
My life, now its changed,
My life aint the same as you are,
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it,
If I can't have what mean most to me, So many tears I cried,

Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure Loving you no more,

Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton

Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me [Chorus: Lil Baby]

And when I find it, is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to Better late than never, but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner, you all don't even look at me to pay Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us

It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin' I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up
Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old

Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation

Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
(WOO)
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
(RIGHT)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facin' 8
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully

Ever made love to the woman of your dreams

In a room full of money out in London
(WOO)

Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair

You know the feds listening, nigga what money?
I'm a maid nigga

You niggas on the bench
Like the bus coming
Ha, aint nothing sweet but the swishas
Um folks might as well say cheese for the pictures
Ohhh, I'm about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I aint buying
Chop a dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like Mayans

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Yeah, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh
Yeah Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of c-notes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood and go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, ooh Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You don't want drama, capisce?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlemagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna' pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are No more, no more
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah
No more, no more

Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how I feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if it wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal
Could it be the way that I'll catch up(×9)"

I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like ""who's this?""
I be like ""me, girl.""
You be like ""oh word, true shit?""
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
Them car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel like I ain't have it like that
I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I'm not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain't even see my friends that year Places that I should've been
You ain't really fuck with me way back then but how 'bout now?

Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place: not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of ""Mr. Perfect""
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, ah
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)
Take a shot for me (hooooooo-ooooooh)
Take a shot for me (aha-aha-aha-aha-aha-aha)

tuesday,drake,"Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosay Squad goin' up, nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on the sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, ""Bring the juice, we about to get lit""
Fill the room up with some teens, one night off and this is it
Always workin' over T, overtime and out of town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep, shit I'm talkin' must be too true
Upstairs got xan's in a Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gonna' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we have the club going up Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosay Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
Ain't got fuckin' time to party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly prant
I got the loudest of the loud, you know I got stink
My P.O think I'm in the house
Don't give a damn bout, what she think Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosay And I know I know how I made it on my own
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta' go, you're moving too fast
Don't wanna move slow
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosay"
from-time,drake,"What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause... I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of? Darling you, you give but you cannot take love I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple nas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh? Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

Why do I want an independent woman to feel like she needs me?

I don't want you here with someone else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me

Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syd had a baby and treated me different
Erica sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they was here, shit could have been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And that is too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options

I'll kill somebody if they give you problems

Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'

I like a bad bitch from a decent home
me and Tip, thats that pimpin' that we preachin' on
and everybody tryna listen nigga, speakerphone [Chorus] [T.I.]
I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me
cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
everything brand new, you get money like who?
spent 150 on my car and my Audemar too
when I walk up in the spot, aint nobody saw you
they see me like ""there he go""
look at you like "" ahh who?""
bought every bottle at the bar
shortie you know how I do
I take em all across your, I aint finna argue
still big shit poppin, nothing changed but my clothes
triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
tell the bitch I take you places where your man can't go
can't be, he aint doing shit, if he aint me
cant you see the difference between us when I walkin to the door
your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
fifty stack, I'mma show you how to ball, triple that [Chorus]"
